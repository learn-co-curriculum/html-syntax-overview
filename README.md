# HTML Basics

## Getting Started

HTML is the language of the web, so, as a user of the web, it’s the language you
have spent the majority of your time with, whether you knew it or not. Now we’re
going to take a closer look at how it works.

## Anatomy of an HTML Tag

The fundamental building block of HTML is a __tag__. Tags allow web developers
to tell things to the browser like "make this text a header" or "include this
image". Tags all follow the same format as this:

```html
<tag-text>
```

It's just some text wrapped in `<` and `>` characters. The most basic tag is
the "break" tag. This is represented in HTML as `<br>` and tells the browser to
create a new line. Over the next few lessons, we are going to create a simple
profile page for a brand-new Flatiron student.

<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='intro br' src='//codepen.io/joemburgess/embed/MoJLVL/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=html,result&embed-version=2&editable=true' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/joemburgess/pen/MoJLVL/'>intro br</a> by Joe Burgess (<a href='https://codepen.io/joemburgess'>@joemburgess</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

Go ahead and add in more `<br>` tags and text and see what happens.

## Opening and Closing Tags

While the break tag is very useful, the first thing we need for our profile page
is a header. Good news &mdash; there’s a tag for that! It's the `<h1>` tag. This
will make the text larger and bolder, and make it the most clearly important
text on the page. Now, we don't want _all of our text_ as a header. To tell the
browser which text should be a header, and which shouldn't, we use closing tags.
Closing tags are the same as tags you've seen before but prefixed with a `/`. The
closing tag for `<h1>` would be `</h1>`. Take a look at this in action:

<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='closing tags' src='//codepen.io/joemburgess/embed/BZpMPJ/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=html,result&embed-version=2&editable=true' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/joemburgess/pen/BZpMPJ/'>closing tags</a> by Joe Burgess (<a href='https://codepen.io/joemburgess'>@joemburgess</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

Any text you put between the `<h1>` and `</h1>` will be a header. Pretty great,
right?

Most HTML tags work just like this:

1. Opening tag, which states what kind of tag we’re using;
2. The text we want the tag to be applied to;
3. Closing tag, which makes sure the tag is limited to a certain piece of text.

So when we talk about “what kind of tag we’re using,” what are our options? How
many HTML tags are there? There are a lot! Another useful example is the
__paragraph__ tag which is represented with a `<p>` and `</p>`. The paragraph tag tells the
browser the text in between it is a paragraph and puts two new lines above and
below the text.

<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='p tag' src='//codepen.io/joemburgess/embed/owBmQL/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=html,result&embed-version=2&editable=true' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/joemburgess/pen/owBmQL/'>p tag</a> by Joe Burgess (<a href='https://codepen.io/joemburgess'>@joemburgess</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

When we’ve put all these pieces together—opening tag, content, closing tag—we
now have a larger piece we call an HTML __element__.

## Document Structure

While most of writing HTML is writing tags like the ones above, there are some
special tags that tell the browser about what's coming up. These are tags that
are never seen by users, but the browser uses them to understand the external
resources your web page needs. Here is a full example of a web page:

<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='Intro to HTML' src='//codepen.io/joemburgess/embed/jwydYp/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=html,result&embed-version=2&editable=true' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/joemburgess/pen/jwydYp/'>Intro to HTML</a> by Joe Burgess (<a href='https://codepen.io/joemburgess'>@joemburgess</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

You'll notice that the web page looks identical to the one above. If you look at
the code you will see three new tags: `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. You
might have also spotted these tags in the last lesson when we looked under the
surface of [flatironschool.com][site] and peeked at the HTML underneath. That’s
because these three tags are in every single webpage. Here’s what they do:

[site]: https://flatironschool.com

- The `<html>` tag tells the browser "hey contained in here is a bunch of HTML
  code."
- The `<head>` tag we won't use just yet, but it will contain our
  references to outside bits of code such as CSS or Javascript.
- The `<body>` tag tells the browser "contained in here is the stuff I want you
  to show the user."

In many future examples, we will omit the `html`, `body` and `head` tags due to
brevity. Be sure to remember them when you create your own websites though!

## Summary

Congratulations! Now you know how we build __HTML__. All HTML uses __tags__, and
most tags come in pairs of an __opening tag__ and a __closing tag__. There are a
lot of existing HTML tags we can use to display text on webpages, such as `<h1>`
`</h1>` and `<p>` `</p>`. A set of HTML tags with enclosed content is an HTML
__element__. We use the `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags to define our
overall HTML __document structure__.
